# Development machine bootstrap

Utilizes [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) to setup a development machine (assumes it will be a macOS system).

## Usage

From the command line do

```bash
$ ./provision
```

This will run the Ansible scripts. Currently assumes you already have ansible installed on the system.
